This project successfully reproduced the Stroop effect and Flanker effect, 
supporting the established paradigms of cognitive interference. 
The findings provide valuable insights into attentional processes and
inhibitory mechanisms underlying human cognition and reveals a notable difference in reaction times between the congruent and incongruent conditions
during the Stroop task and Flanker task. 
Nonetheless, the assessment of accuracy does not demonstrate a substantial distinction between these two conditions.
These results highlight the importance of cognitive psychology research in understanding fundamental aspects of human information processing.
